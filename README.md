<h3><b>Objectives:</b></h3>

- Learn how to design a Markdown note-taking application in React that can help one to quickly jot down notes and save notes to the browser's localStorage.

- Use the React library to create the User Interface as it would handle the updating of the DOM as required.

- Install and learn to use npm packages such as:

        react-split: A simple yet powerful and extensible React Markdown Editor that aims to have feature parity with the Github Markdown editor.

        nanoid: A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for JavaScript.

        react-mde:  Which renders React components within the markdown and markdown as React components
